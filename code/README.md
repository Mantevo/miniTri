This directory contains the actual software implementations for the miniTri miniapp.
We have developed several different implementations of miniTri using different 
fundamental methods.  The code is organized as follows:

* __linearAlgebra__ -- contains Graph BLAS like, linear algebra-based miniTri implementations
* __linearAlgebraMethod2__ -- contains implementations of alternative linear algebra-based miniTri formulation
* __utils__ -- contains helper functions that are common to different implementations
