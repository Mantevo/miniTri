triangleCounting:
------------------------------------------------

This directory contains triangleCounting software that has been developed as a by-product
of the miniTri miniapp development.
We have developed several different implementations of using different 
fundamental methods.  The code is organized as follows:

* __linearAlgebra__ -- contains Graph BLAS like, linear algebra-based miniTri implementations
* __utils__ -- contains helper functions that are common to different implementations
