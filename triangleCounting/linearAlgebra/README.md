This directory contains triangle counting software that has been developed as a by-product
of the miniTri miniapp development.  In particular, this directory includes several different
linear algebra-based methods.  The code is organized as follows:

* __AH__ -- Number of triangles = sum((A*H)==2)/3
* __LU__ -- Number of triangles = sum( (L*U) .* L)
